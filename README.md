# Self-Supervised Video Transformers with DINO Framework for Video Summarization

This Project employs a method for video summarization with self-supervised learning using a self-supervised video transformer and the DINO framework. The goal is to enhance the efficiency of video summarization techniques through state-of-the-art frameworks in machine learning.

The Code is based on SVT, DINO and TimeSformer Repositories
